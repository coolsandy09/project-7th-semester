		   <h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>
				Rahul Sahoo and Sandeep Sah: We are developing an Entertainment list tracker. It provides the user with a catalog of different items available to watch in the store. In order to facilitate the online watching experience, a profile account  is provided to the user. This multi-tiered architecture, is to be implemented using MYSQL and PHP. This project has been developed with an objective to develop a basic website where a consumer is provided with a account on website with  proper authentication. Here SQL Server has been used for relational database management system. SQL Server is a database management system using a language called SQL. Google Chrome or any other browser will provide GUI interface for Database so that the consumer can do all the things upon logging in. The system is partially implemented before or during the analysis phase, thereby giving the customers an opportunity to see the items early in the life cycle. This document is used to build the initial prototype supporting only the basic functionality as desired by the customer.
